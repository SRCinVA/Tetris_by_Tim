Problem areas:

       4:00 -- on top_left_x and top_left_y
       9:54 --  his reasoning on how to display locked pieces 
	             makes no sense at all.
     16:21 -- don't understand his reasoning here
     26:49 -- win = pygame.display.set_mode()  ... ? "win" as in "victory"?
     31:00 -- i * block_size: i is the stand-in for y. OK. But why multiplication? 
		  Does it re-create every line every time all the way to the end?
     34:00 -- don't get the use of % here.
     35:38 -- why will j be 0 and column be a period? Makes no sense.
     36:18 -- is it for every individual x,y and j,i?
     38:00 -- unclear why the (3,4) position would result.
     38:47 -- why subtract 2 and 4? 
     41:04 -- what is 'j for sub'?
     45:39 -- if y < 1, "equal to 0 or greater". This statement is nonsense.
     48:32 -- Speed and time are not the same.
     51:52 -- why would the shapes spawn at the bottom of the screen?
  1:00:06 -- uses modulus again to find the rotational sub-list.
  1:00:33 -- what does list(line) do?
  1:10:00 -- clear_row function is generally confusing 
  1:30:36 -- "f as" ?? This function is generally hard to follow.
